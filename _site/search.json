    "text": "Project Motivation\nAs a small, low-lying city-state, Singapore is vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels, intense rainfall, dry spells and other extreme weather events. In Jan 2024, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) announced the Third National Climate Change Study (V3) which provided a preview into potential scenarios of our future based on low, medium, and high global greenhouse gas emissions. Very hot days will become more frequent. Extreme daily rainfall is projected to intensify. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise up to 1.15m by end century, and up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario.\nAdapting to the effects of climate change is a national priority and Singapore has started to integrate long-term adaptation planning into national policies for key sectors including food security, public health, infrastructure resilience, flood risks, water security, coastal line and biodiversity, as indicated in its intended Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nIt is important that we take a closer look into how climate change has been affecting Singapore, by understanding the trends in our daily temperatures, rainfall and sea level rise over the years and utilise historical data to forecast future climate data. This will allow us to ascertain the severity of the impact of climate change and provide guidance as to whether Singapore will need to more urgently develop ways to mitigate and adapt."
